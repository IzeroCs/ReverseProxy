# This Reverse Proxy is used to update the dynamic public IP of the network router, no longer depending on Dynamic DNS.

**public.key, private.key:** Two files need to be created and in order to enter a directory, the path of the two files can be set in **.env**. Two files are used for **[JsonWebToken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken)**

**secret.key:** This file also needs to be created and in order to enter a directory, the path can be set in .env. File used for **[CryptoJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-js)** to encrypt the authentication message to the server

**proxy.json** structure used for **[Redbird](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redbird)**, this file is created manually and is optional:
```
{
    "src": "target",

    "http://example.com":     "http://127.0.0.1:3000",
    "https://example.com":    "http://127.0.0.1:4000",
    "http://sub.example.com": "http://127.0.0.1:5000"
}
```

- **src:** If there is **https://** in the **src**, then automatically check in the Let's Encrypt folder set in **.env**. If there exist two files privkey.pem and cert.pem will enable ssl for that src-domain. If there is no scheme, the default will be **http://**

- **target:** With target, it can be internal IP or domain.

**ip.server, ip.client**: These two files are generated by the system when operating, it is used to save the router's public IP after authentication is complete, no pre-creation is required. Can set save path in **.env**
